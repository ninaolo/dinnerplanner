# Dinnerplanner

This is two different stages of a project in interaction programming at KTH. It's a web app written in AngularJS.

`dinnerplanner-lab4`: This is a more simple version of the project with an MVC pattern but without using AngularJS's services/factories.
`dinnerplanner-lab5`: This is the final version of the project, using services/factories.
